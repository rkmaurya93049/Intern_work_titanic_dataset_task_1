# Intern_work_titanic_dataset_task_1
-> In this task I work with the titanic dataset in this dataset there are several missing values and outliers were present for the cleaning and preprocessing this dataset first of all i import this dataset and then i little bit explore about data set. i was found that the in this data set there are missing values present in the "Cabin","Embarked" and "Age" column i Handled the missing values and after that I encoded the categorical column to numerical column and also did Normalization and Standardization after that i plot the boxplot of numerical column and i found that there were several outlier present in this dataset so I used capping method to handle the outliers.

# Problems:
  -> first problem i faced in "cabin" column while encoding this because  in this column  "Numeric and string" both this values were present so I were unable to encode this.
# Solution:
  -> So for solving this problem i splited the Cabin column in two different column and after that the problem was solve.
